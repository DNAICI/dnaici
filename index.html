         <p class="left-line-spacing"> <br>  
            To model and analyze the dynamics of intra-chromosomal interactions is challenging, especially when multiple high-dimensional epigenetic data are needed to be integrated.
             A computational integrative approach was proposed here to identify differential intra-chromosomal interactions by integrating Hi-C data with other genomic data, and a novel hyperparameter tuning method facilitating network clustering is developed to identify valid intra-chromosomal communities at different interaction resolutions.
              We first trained our computational approach on Hi-C data and other epigenetic data in an untreated and one hour estrogen (E2)-treated tamoxifen-sensitive (TS) breast cancer cell line, MCF7 and revealed two major types of valid intra-chromosomal communities - active/repressive compartments, respectively, which resembles the properties of open/closed chromatin domains. 
              We further tested it on MCF7 and tamoxifen-resistant (TR) breast cancer cell line, MCF7TR, and identified 515 differential interacting and differentially expressed genes (DIEGs) within intra-chromosomal community interactions. 
            The GO and pathway analyses of these DIEGs revealed that endocrine resistance is among the top biological pathways, suggesting a looping-mediated mechanism in regulating breast cancer tamoxifen resistance.
             Our computational approach is anticipated to have a broader application in many other biological systems for identifying a biological-specific differential community interaction.

                The differential sub-networks are composed of selected nodes and significant Hi-C intra-chromosomal interactions between them, where the selected nodes are identified based on a differential network analysis incorporating topological and genomic features between MCF7 cells and tamoxifen-resistant MCF7TR cells at 50kb resolution (p-value < 0.05 for differential interacting nodes; absolute (relative ratio) > 0.66 for differentially expressed genes).
                 The orange and blue colors in the nodes represent whether the histone markers of the community are active or not. The colors of the outer rings represent previously identified intra-chromosomal communities.
                  Gray lines between nodes represent significant Hi-C intra-chromosomal interactions. All the figures are visualized by Cytoscape based on the Supplementary file 5-8.
